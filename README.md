I have read about RNN, LSTM and GAN's from the resources below.

1. [Understanding LSTM â€“ a tutorial into Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09586)
2. [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)

Implementations of the above are here in this repository.


Additionaly, I am currently going through [StoryGAN: A Sequential Conditional GAN for Story Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02784)  
and will soon begin implementing it.
